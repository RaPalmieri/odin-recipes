<!-- Description of the recipe -->

    <h3> About: </h3>
    <p> A schnitzel is a thin slice of meat. The meat is usually thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer. Most commonly, the meat is breaded before frying. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey. Schnitzel is very similar to the dish escalope in France, tonkatsu in Japan, cotoletta in Italy, kotlet schabowy in Poland, milanesa in Argentina, chuleta valluna in Colombia and "chicken fried steak" of the Southern United States.  </p>

<!-- Steps to cook -->

    <h3> Steps to follow: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> <em> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place baking sheet in preheated oven. </em> </li>
            <li> <em> Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season chicken with salt and pepper. </em> </li>
            <li> <em> Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together on a separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, then egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean plate. Repeat with remaining chicken. </em> </li>
            <li> <em> Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece of coated chicken. </em> </li>
            <li> <em> Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </em> </li>
            <li> <em> <strong> Enjoy! </strong> </em> </li>
        </ol>
